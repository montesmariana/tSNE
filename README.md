# tSNE

This site uses [tsne.js](https://github.com/karpathy/tsnejs) as well as inspiration from [this post](https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/)
to show how the t-SNE algorithm seeks a 2D representation of distances.

The distances shown here represent similarities between instances of *herhalen* in a corpus of Flemish and Dutch newspaper;
[here](https://montesmariana.github.io/tSNE/twoModels.html) two clouds can be compared.
